# -Test-automation-framework-in-web-based-applications
A framework that automates the web browser. The test cases were created using Selenium IDE and were run on the Jenkins Continuous Integration Pipeline. Jenkins was used to reliably build, test and deploy our test cases in one place using CI/CD Pipeline. A test report is also generated at the end of every test we automated using TestNG framework.
